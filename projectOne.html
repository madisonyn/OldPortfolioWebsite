          <br>
          AfterEffects can be a tool for prototyping and communicating motion
          that ultimately will be built in code. In this exercise, I created
          an animated logo that transitions to a website interface.
          Using my knowledge of motion design and kinetic typography,
          I produced a short video that demonstrates the flow of the website
          UI as if someone was browsing the site.
          <br>
          <br>
          My design process began with developing a company and brand identity.
          “Soiled” is a fictitious company that serves as a digital commercial space
          to purchase plants and related accessories.
          <br>
          <br>
          I designed a logo that incorporates the company name while depicting its
          reference to the company’s main commodity, plants. The website itself is
          designed to be simple, playful, and intuitive. Features to note are the cursor
          that changes to a flower symbol when hovering over a clickable item, the flower
          symbol theme appearing in the cursor and loading page, and the opacity changes
          when a certain item is clickable.
