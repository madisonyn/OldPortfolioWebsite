          <br>

          In this project, I was asked to create an insect-based food company
          and design a logo, a graphic standard with collateral material for the
          company. Additionally, I also designed and created a shelf-ready
          prototype of the package design for my product.
          <br>
          <br>
          My process started with searching for a company identity, using simple
          sketches and word association to flesh out ideas. I decided on an
          insect-popcorn mixture, with popcorn made from dried insect powder and
          settled on “CrunchCorn” for its catchy alliteration and fun spin-off
          of “popcorn.” In the burgeoning industry of insect food products,
          Crunch Corn provides a unique option of crunchy insects, such as
          mealworms and crickets, in combination with popcorn coated with
          insect dust. Our initiative at Crunch Corn is to understand
          consumer concerns regarding insect-based foods and we strive
          to offer a product that is easily approachable.

          The final logo features a 4 inch and 1 inch version for different
          sized products or additional marketing. They both incorporate a
          gradient purple effect and rounded lettering to create a playful
          and engaging effect. The graphic standard serves to set the tone
          for the brand identity and establish a guideline for typography,
          color palette, logo specifications, and the business system.
          <br>
          <br>
          In my package design, I aimed to design a container that would be
          protective, secure, and also allow for resealability to maintain
          freshness. I decided on a hexagonal shaped container with long
          protruding edges that act as a mechanism of protection to the contents
          inside if the package were dropped or crushed. It also features a
          removable lid and two inside flaps that provide additional protection
          from outside elements.
