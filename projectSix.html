          Problem
          <br>
          <br>
          After visiting the Richmond Greenway, it was insightful to observe the
          successful developments and areas of improvement that could be
          transformed to better serve the community and enhance involvement.
          42nd Street Pocket Park is a sector along the greenway that appears
          to be neglected, yet it has the potential to be a space that offers
          safety and ownership to Richmond residents and frequent visitors.
          The space is cozy and provides an opportunity for play and
          community events, however, it currently lacks active use which
          can be attributed to a lack of upkeep, knowledge of the existing
          space, and a cohesive and distinct visual identity.
          <br>
          <br>
          Objective
          <br>
          <br>
          My project aims to develop appropriate and attractive signage and
          wayfinding material with a streamlined visual identity for 42nd
          Street Pocket Park to increase activation of the space and produce
           more user-friendly areas along the greenway.

      My project consists of a few different pieces that rely on each other
      to develop an impactful visual identity and an activated space for
      42nd Street Pocket Park. The main park sign is a larger statement
      piece that marks the arrival of the park while acting as its main
      signifier. With a large, visible sign, people will be more aware
      of the intentional use of the space. The visual graphic identity
      is strongly emphasized on this sign. The visual itself is colorful
       and playful to cultivate a friendly atmosphere around and within
       the park.

      My second piece of signage addresses navigational confusion and to
      increase awareness of the park, I created a series of wayfinding
      signage that directs people on the greenway to the park. The signage
      is intended to appeal to all users on the greenway, either on
      foot, on a bike, or even on a skateboard! Informationally,
      the sign allows greenway users to easily determine their current
      distance from the park and the estimated amount of time it would
      take to arrive there on their specific mode of transportation. It
       also features both English and Spanish to increase accessibility
       and inclusivity. The top also has an element of the park’s visual
       graphic identity that can be found on all signage material for 42nd
        Street Pocket Park.

      The last piece of signage is a continually updating or changing events
      poster and scheduling calendar to inform visitors of events occurring
      during the month at the park or in other areas around the greenway.
      These could be volunteering events with Groundwork Richmond or other
      affiliated stakeholders of the greenway. This signage serves to engage
       the community in events that support the growth of their space to
       create positive returns back to them. As a temporary part of the park,
       it could be pinned to a wall for ease of changing. It could also have
       it’s own built structure or mantle that contains the posters which can
        be easily switched for the following month’s events.
